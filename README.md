# CrossWorking

Final graduation project for PS course of the 2122 summer Semester, developed by:

* Lourenço Vala - https://github.com/lourencovala
* David Lourenço - https://github.com/dashwoodboy

Oriented by João Trindade.

## Description

In the final semester of our program there is a course worth 3 entire courses (18 ECTS). In it you are supposed to develop your own semi-large scale project, in order to prove the abilities you learned and practiced in the previous semesters.  
For this task, me and my colleague David choose to develop a platform called CrossWorking.

### Abstract taken from the report

Up until now the development of humanity was largely due to the ideas of some of the 
most important people in our history and their ability to put these ideas to practice with their 
knowledge.  
In today’s age, most people choose to specialize in a particular field whilst neglecting the 
rest. This makes it particularly difficult for them to put into practice easy and rentable ideas, which could change society.  
To fight this issue a platform was designed for people to be able to share their ideas, their 
knowledge, and their skills. The users of this platform can save their ideas and skills in their 
profile, so the ideas shared to them are related to their expertise. Afterwards they can apply to one of these ideas, and should they be accepted by the creator, they will enter in contact to commence development.  
For this platform a Web API (Application Programming Interface) was developed and 
deployed in a HTTP server, to manipulate the data required for this service. As for the user 
interface (UI), the Android Framework was chosen. For the data to be persistent, a relational 
database was created, as well as an object storage service.  
Although the UI chosen for this platform was an Android application, the Web API was 
developed with consideration for future expansion into other types of front-end.

## Project organization

The code is divided into 2 projects:

* [android](android/) - Android Studio project for android app.
* [server](server/) - IntelliJ IDE project for Web API.
